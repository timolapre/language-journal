# Project: Personal Language Learning Website

## 1. Core Technologies

- **Framework:** Next.js (using the App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first approach)
- **UI Components:** shadcn
- **Package Manager:** Yarn
- **Language:** TypeScript (preferred for type safety and modern features)

## 2. Design Philosophy

- **UI/UX:** Simple, clean, modern, intuitive, and visually appealing. Prioritize ease of use.
- **Responsiveness:** The website is primarily designed for phones. Ensure it is fully responsive, especially on mobile devices, while also supporting larger screens.

## 3. Coding Standards

- **Code Style:** Follow standard Next.js and React best practices. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features appropriately.
- **Components:** Create reusable and well-defined React components. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript strictly for better code quality and maintainability. Define clear types and interfaces.
- **Comments:** Add comments only for complex logic or non-obvious parts. Avoid redundant comments.

## 4. Project Structure

- Adhere to the standard Next.js App Router project structure.
- Organize components, hooks, utils, and types logically (e.g., within a `src` directory).

## 5. Deployment

- Target Vercel for deployment, leveraging its seamless integration with Next.js.
